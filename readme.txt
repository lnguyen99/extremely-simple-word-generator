Comments: 
- I am happy that my code is functional and each method only has one function. The code is fairly easy to read with clearly named methods and variables. 

- The problem is the running time is quite slow in my opinion. I try to eliminate as much loop as possible. It works fine for short file, but for longer file (hamlet.txt and as_you_like_it.txt), it takes the program a few second to run. 

- Also, it would be great to have a shorter and faster way to read all the information in the plain text files, including white spaces.
